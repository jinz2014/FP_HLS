Jing: 
Unfortunately, the spring semester begun with a heavy snow and the campus was closed yesterday. So I was trapped at my shabby room the whole day. 

Did you hear the sad news about the death of a 9-year-old girl? She was born and dead in tragedy. What a dramatic destiny. A lot of people will remember her faint smile and bright black eyes.

What does the weather look like in New Orleans? Are you busy with work recently?

Allan:
I think you must have been back from home. There is a little pity that the holidays are so short and we will get down to our works. In the holidays, I read quite a few short stories by Fitzgerald, one of the most gifted American writers. Do you think his stories still reflect Americans¡¯ thinking and behaviors? 

I look forward to meeting with you. But the Friday night party makes me think of those tempting meals, white innocence and a religious mystery over the party.  As we stayed here longer, our interests of the Friday party might wane. But it is good to talk with Americans and improve our understandings.

Dr. Bakos:

Trapped by the heavy, icy snow I stayed at my place. It is said that the campus will be closed several days. 
There is no stable internet connection at my shabby home. I made some modifications to the paper last weekend.
Maybe we could not meet and may work on the paper by email.

Thanks,
Zheming
