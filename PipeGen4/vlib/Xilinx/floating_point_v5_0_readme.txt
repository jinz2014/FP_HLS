floating_point_v5_0.asy:
   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some
   third party tools to create a symbol representing the core.

floating_point_v5_0.gise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

floating_point_v5_0.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

floating_point_v5_0.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

floating_point_v5_0.vho:

   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

floating_point_v5_0.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

floating_point_v5_0.xise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

floating_point_v5_0_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

floating_point_v5_0_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.

floating_point_v5_0_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.
