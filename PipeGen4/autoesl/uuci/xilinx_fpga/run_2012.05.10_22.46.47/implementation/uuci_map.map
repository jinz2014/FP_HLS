Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   601 out of  51,840    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,030
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           554 out of   2,030   27%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 478 out of   2,030   23%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         998 out of   2,030   49%
    Number of unique control sets:              24
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              23 out of 207,360    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
