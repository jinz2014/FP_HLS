WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because
   component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing constraint summary
   below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please
   use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line) with the Mapped NCD and
   PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the
   component delays alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components
   as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing
   the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the environment
   variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
   Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE, consult the Xilinx
   Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
