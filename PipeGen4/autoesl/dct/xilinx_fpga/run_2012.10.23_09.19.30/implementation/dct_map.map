Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 7,276 out of  51,840   14%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       23,885
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         8,576 out of  23,885   35%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,999 out of  23,885    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      13,310 out of  23,885   55%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              97 out of 207,360    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
