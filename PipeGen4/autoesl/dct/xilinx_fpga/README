The files in this directory are useful when performing RTL synthesis 
using Xilinx's XST synthesis tool. The scripts also 
implement the design upto place and route using Xilinx mapping, 
placement and routing tools. The following files are included by 
default in this directory:
   README                  (this text file)
   do_synth                (executable Bash script)
   settings.xst            (XST compile script)
   xst.prj                 (XST project script)
   constraints.xcf         (XST constraints file)
   constraints.ucf         (User Constraints File(UCF) )


--------
do_synth
--------

This is a wrapper script which allows PICO-produced RTL to be easily synthesized
using Xilinx XST synthesis tool. do_synth also invokes the Xilinx mapper (map),
place & route (par) and trace (trce) tools to implement the design. 
The 'run/synthesis/' sub-directory holds the results of the RTL synthesis run and the 
'run/implementation/' sub-directory holds the results of the implementation run.

-------------
settings.xst
xst.prj
-------------

These are the XST synthesis script and project file, and can be used as-is, or used as
an example to develop your own scripts.  In all cases, examine the scripts to
ensure the settings are appropriate for your requirement.

---------------
constraints.xcf
---------------

This is the XST constraints file, and can be used as-is, or used as
an example to develop your own constraints file. The timing
constraints specified in PICO are propagated to this constraints file.

---------------
constraints.ucf
---------------

This is the User Constraints File, used to specify timing constraints
to map/par. This can be used as-is, or used as an example to develop 
your own constraints file. The timing constraints specified in PICO 
are propagated to this constraints file.
